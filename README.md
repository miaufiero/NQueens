# NQueens
The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The objective is to develop an optimized algorithm addressing the weaknesses of existing solutions while ensuring scalability and efficiency.

# N-Queens Solver

## Overview
This project implements various algorithms to solve the **N-Queens problem**, a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. It includes solvers based on **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, **Tournament Selection**, and **Adam & Eve selection strategies**. The project supports automated benchmarking and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes **Genetic Algorithm Solver**, **Tournament Solver**, and an **Analysis Script**.
- **Parallel Computing**: Optimized execution using multi-threading for faster computation.
- **Data Analysis**: Generates CSV reports and visualizations using Python (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- **Command-line Interface**: Allows users to configure problem size, algorithm selection, and debugging options.
