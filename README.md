# NQueens
The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The objective is to develop an optimized algorithm addressing the weaknesses of existing solutions while ensuring scalability and efficiency.

# N-Queens Solver

## Overview
This project implements various algorithms to solve the **N-Queens problem**, a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. It includes solvers based on **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, **Tournament Selection**, and **Adam & Eve selection strategies**. The project supports automated benchmarking and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes **Genetic Algorithm Solver**, **Tournament Solver**, and an **Analysis Script**.
- **Parallel Computing**: Optimized execution using multi-threading for faster computation.
- **Data Analysis**: Generates CSV reports and visualizations using Python (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- **Command-line Interface**: Allows users to configure problem size, algorithm selection, and debugging options.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** (or later)
- **Python 3.x** with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- **Windows, Linux, or macOS** (multi-platform support)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NQueensSolver.git
   cd NQueensSolver
   ```
2. Compile the C# project:
   ```sh
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```
3. Run the solver:
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project src/Driver.cs
   ```
4. Run an automated experiment:
   ```sh
   python run_nqueens.py
   ```
5. Analyze the results:
   ```sh
   python analyze_nqueens.py
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Solver
You can run the solver interactively or via command-line parameters.

#### Interactive Mode
```sh
dotnet run
```
- Enter the board size `N` (e.g., `8` for an 8x8 board).
- Select an algorithm:
  - `[1] Genetic Algorithm`
  - `[2] Tournament Solver`
- Enable or disable debug mode.
- Specify the number of random seed iterations.

#### Automated Execution
```sh
dotnet run -- 16 Genetic 42 true
```
- `16`: Board size (N=16)
- `Genetic`: Algorithm type (`Genetic` or `Tournament`)
- `42`: Random seed for reproducibility
- `true`: Enable debug output

### Running Batch Experiments
To execute multiple experiments automatically:
```sh
python run_nqueens.py
```
This will iterate through different values of `N`, solvers, and random seeds.

### Analyzing Results
Once experiments are complete, generate visualizations:
```sh
python analyze_nqueens.py
```
This will generate:
- **Elapsed Time Comparison** (`elapsed_time_comparison.png`)
- **Time Complexity Scatter Plot** (`time_complexity_comparison.png`)
- **Failure Rate Bar Chart** (`failure_rate_comparison.png`)
